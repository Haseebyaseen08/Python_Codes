# Python_Codes

# Graphs
In Graphs, there are basic codes along with the simple tasks like "possible routes" and "create graph on Neo4j of story".
Graph used in most codes is following.

# Genetic Alogrithm
Genetic Algorithm can basic equation variables' value finder.
1. Take expression
2. Modify it
3. Genrate population
4. Calculate fitness
5. Apply Mutation and Crossover
6. Select new genration
7. Moves to Step 4, untill condition meets.

# ANNs
Basic task of ANNs using python is performed
1. Create perceptron that handel Logical Gate AND or OR having 2 inputs and 1 output, and return Weights.
2. Same above task with using bais input
3. Cerate perceptron which can handel any numaric dataset with 1 target output, and return weights if completely learned otherwise become infinite loop as there is no "Epochs" introduced.

4.ANN on XOR training and IRIS dataset using Keras, (Created the ANN structure of own choice.)

# ML Project
Basic dataset playing task on Titanic Dataset. Step includes as following:
1. Dataset filtering
2. Label dataset attributes
  (2.1) Label Encoding
  (2.2) One Hot Encoding
3. Split Dataset for training and testing sets
   (3.1) Use train-test split in one code
   (3.2) Use K-fold in other (K=10)
4. Apply 10 algorithms from Scikit Learn Library
5. Pick up the best one.
6. Genrate Confession metrix and calculate F1, Accuracy etc of each Algorithm
7. Created the most basic front end, and connect the best performed to it to make predictions.
